# Supportability Office Hours 
## Objective: 
Weekly sync between Support Squad Captain (SC) and Supportability Program Managers (SPMs) to review top issues, areas of concern and share updates/feedback relevant to respective teams. To pilot this program, we'll begin with the [Worktent squad](https://github.com/github/support-squad-worktent) and expand the meeting roster as we move forward. 

**This meeting is currently designed around US PT and APAC working hours - with more regional office hours to cover US ET and EMEA coming soon.**

## General Meeting Format:
1. **Introductions:** opportunity for Hubber attendees to introduce themselves/team.
2. **Discuss key tickets/issues:** what issues did Support encounter, what solutions and next steps can we take?
3. **Parking lot:** cross functionally beneficial updates, open topics and discussions not covered in key tickets and issues.
